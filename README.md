## Liquid Paint \*new\*


</div>

### Description

For those who don't know what this does just d'load it and take a look. The premise is that you can draw pictures and they appear to "move" at the colours cycle.

An update to the code I submitted last night. This version has: drawing with both squares and circles, as well as delete. It also allows you to change the colour scheme to get different effects.
